# Code-Cracker-Puzzle-Game

## Overview

This program is a game that can be played in terminal or a Tkinter window and is based on the game Mastermind. You are able to take guesses at what a 3 digit code is. Your accuracy is described by the output by showing you:
  - How many numbers are correct and in the correct position
  - How many numbers are correct but in the wrong position

## Usage

There are two files, one to run in the terminal window, and one that runs in a tkinter window (a nice Graphical User Interface that comes with Python). As long as Python is installed both of these programs should run fine.

In a terminal window in the root folder of this project you can run ```python Mastermind_Puzzle_Game_terminal.py``` to begin the game in a terminal or ```python Mastermind_Puzzle_Game_tkinter.py``` to run the game in a Tkinter window!
